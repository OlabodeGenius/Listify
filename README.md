Listify is an interactive platform where users can Join an Online Room. Your room includes Songs, and songs can be added to your room's Queue, Which enable all the connecitons in the same room to watch the same song/video at the same time. Including Streaming experience like having a nice chat in the room and Currency to upvote the song on queue to played first.
This currency will gain while you active in the room.

## Inspired Idea
Imagine you are attending your friend's birthday party and guests have song requests they would like to play but differ in tastes of music. Or imagine board game night where everyone has differing music tastes but only 1 device connected to the speaker. Or imagine a situtation where your significant other is remote but you would like to have a shared music experience. Or imagine growing your own following by hosting your own music request channel where members from around the globe can request, upvote, and suggest other songs, or imagine an application to create and manage your own playlists and/or can share them with a global community
